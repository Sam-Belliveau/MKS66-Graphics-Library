## History

Much of the code for this graphics engine is adapted from a previous graphics engine I made called (SPGL)[https://github.com/Sam-Belliveau/SPGL]. SPGL was just a very simple frame buffer that allowed you to edit the pixels on the screen. Some of the classes used were adapted to make life easier in this graphics engine. SPGL has ceased development, so these classes will be modified to better fit my needs.
